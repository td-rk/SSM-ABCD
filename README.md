# C3: Channelized, Common-State, Cubic-Readout-Tensor SSM

C3 (Channelized, Common-State, Cubic-Readout-Tensor SSM) is an extension of the standard State Space Model (SSM) architecture.  
The key structural modification is that the output projection C becomes a 3‑dimensional tensor, while the state transition matrix A and input matrix B remain conventional 2‑dimensional matrices.

No additional architectural constraints are required; the essence of C3 lies solely in the 3D C‑tensor.

## Conpornent
### 1. Multi‑View SSM
- The matrices A and B are constructed using HiPPO.
- The C‑tensor enables the model to generate multiple outputs from different viewpoints.
- Each slice of the C‑tensor acts as an independent readout head, providing diverse representations of the shared state.

This multi‑view mechanism enhances the expressive power of the SSM without altering its core dynamics.

### 2. Attention Model
The outputs from the multi‑view SSM, together with a small window of recent raw input data, are fed into an Attention module.

The Attention module:
- Integrates long‑term information captured by the SSM  
- Combines it with short‑term, high‑resolution raw input  
- Produces a unified feature vector that balances both memory scales

### 3. MLP
The MLP plays a role similar to the Feed‑Forward Network (FFN) in Transformers.

Its responsibilities include:
- Applying nonlinear transformations  
- Expanding representational capacity  
- Mapping the integrated features to the final output space
